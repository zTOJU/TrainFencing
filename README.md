# 🤺 TrainFencing

Organization of training competitions in fencing.

## 👋 Description

As part of the computer science lessons at my school in the last semester, shortly before the final A-level exams, I was required to develop and implement a practical project of my own choice. I decided to develop a small desktop program that would massively simplify the organization and execution of fencing training competitions and be easy to use. The final project was graded with the highest number of points.

## 🔥 Features
* Adding participants
  * Export a list of them as a PDF
* Adding round results that have been checked very strictly
  * Export a pool (Tableau) as a PDF
* Receiving results that are generated by calculating the point indexes
  * Export a list of them as a PDF

## 🔧 Getting Started

### Dependencies

* OS: Windows
* If you want to edit something, you will need a working version of Delphi 7 from Embarcadero

### Installing & Executing program

* Download this repository (main branch)
* Run TrainFencing.exe or compile your own executable in the delphi project

## ✨ Future

I may come back to this project in the future and develop a universal version in form of a web application.
